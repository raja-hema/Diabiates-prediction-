# Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design.

# Problem Definition:

Developing an AI system to predict diabetes risk using machine learning algorithms, enabling early risk assessment and personalized preventive measures for individuals.

# Design Thinking:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather medical data (glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc.) along with diabetes status information.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, normalize, and prepare medical data for machine learning model training.
3. **Feature Selection:** Identify relevant features influencing diabetes risk prediction.
4. **Model Selection:** Experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
5. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
6. **Iterative Improvement:** Fine-tune model parameters and explore feature engineering techniques for enhanced accuracy
